- **Jt_fornur_dez16_lncCod.fasta.gz**: transcripts assembled based on RNASeq data from foragers and nurses of *T. angustula*. Assembly method described in the manuscript. 

- **common.stats.R**: R function used to test overlap significance between DET in the two species. Used parameters in the manuscript are included.

- **expected_GCmethylation.R**: R script used to test if the mean amount of CG methylation observed is greater than expected based on the proportion of CG sites in the transcriptome.
